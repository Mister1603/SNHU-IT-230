SNHU IT-230
The application was created to handle arithmetic operations, data type conversions, and student registration in both console and WPF formats. Its main goal was to meet the needs of different types of users by offering a fast, text-based interface for technical users and a more guided graphical interface for those who prefer visual interaction. What I did well in development was keeping the process modular and incremental, which allowed me to focus on one feature at a time and ensure it worked properly before moving on. The console version relied on straightforward prompts and direct input, while the WPF version included forms, labels, and buttons that guided users with visual cues and validation. These designs were successful because they considered usability, whether through simplicity in the console or clarity in the WPF interface.

The process of debugging and coding was approached methodically by isolating problems, testing individual features, and making targeted fixes, such as correcting conditional statements or refining methods. This strategy helped me quickly identify and resolve issues, and it is a technique I can use in future projects along with unit testing to increase efficiency. Innovation came into play when bridging console and WPF development, as I needed to ensure that the same core logic worked effectively in two very different environments. Creating shared logic and designing user validation in the WPF application required creative problem-solving, but this allowed me to overcome challenges and deliver a complete solution.
